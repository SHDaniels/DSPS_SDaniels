BAD PLOT:

This plot is from “How does the presence of bar affects the fueling of supermassive black holes ? An IllustrisTNG100 perspective”, ArXiv Preprint 2 November 2023. This plot has two main issues: 
-ambiguity: there is no way to know how densely the points are plotted in the regions where the points overlap. Setting an alpha value to create translucency would allow us to see variation within the dense region.
-incorrectness: the figure caption does not correspond to the figure (the rest of the figures were red and black histograms, so they must have just copied and pasted that part for every caption).

GOOD PLOT:

This figure is from “SuperCAM CO(3 − 2) APEX survey at 6 pc resolution in the Small Magellanic Clouds”, Submitted to the ArXiv on 31 Oct 2023. It is a map, showing locations where this telescope took observations. I like the presence of gridlines for the RA and Dec, because otherwise we would incorrectly assume that they would be straight. The locations of the observations are clear from the white contours, and the yellow contours clearly mark the previously-observed areas. I like that it is superimposed on an image so that we can see where the matter is and get a sense of why they looked at this region. I wish that there were a colorbar for the 24 micrometer part of the image, just because the reader doesn’t necessarily know that the color scale indicates. However, it is not the main point of this graphic, so I’m still calling it a good graphic even though it is missing that information.
