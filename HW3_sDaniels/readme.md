The goal of this homework was to reproduce the statistical analysis of the earthquake paper (Corral 2018).
We learned that it was not fully reprpoducible because we could not access their actual data,
instead needing to do our best with a similar dataset. Plus, their methodology was confusingly written - 
it would have been a big improvement if their code was accessible. We did successfully use the KS test
that we learned about in class, and did not reject the null hypothesis that the distributions
all came from the same parent distribution.

I worked primarily with Tali and Paula, and we added Rayta to our group halfway through as well.
Tali helped me with the magnitude cuts, Sid helped me with turning the :60 seconds into one minute.
Willow helped immensely with understanding how to cut out the too-small time gaps and final cumulative plot.
I passed on what she taught to my group as well as to Miles, Masooma, and Sarah.

The hardest part of the homework was understanding what to do in the final section. The easiest part
was actually doing the KS test (thanks scipy!). I learned how to think about cumulative distributions (and 
many other things).
