This homework was about random forests and gradient boosted trees, 
two types of neural networks for classification/regression that 
we learned about in class. I found that the gradient boosted trees
performed better for our challenge, which was to separate the signal and
noise of the search for higgs bosons.

Tali and I worked together on importing the data. Paula helped with the code for
cleaning the data. and I did the rest by myself.
The hardest part was figuring out how to do feature importance - it took me 
a while to understand the output of np.argsort.
The easiest part was actually running the models, and it was fun to adjust the hyperparameters
to avoid overfitting.
Something new I learned was how to figure out the most important features 
for my classification/regression.
