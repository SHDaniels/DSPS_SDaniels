This homework was about error propagation and galaxy rotation curves. 
I worked with Tali and Zach. Zach and I talked through things but worked
independently, and Tali took responsibility for the Latex derivation and 
also found the distance to andromeda from the paper linked on wikipedia.

The hardest part was figuring out how to plot all the errors with text.
The easiest part was understanding the concept of galaxy rotation curves and dark matter.
One new thing I learned was honestly how to use {x.x}.format() to put
my numbers in print statements more prettily :)
