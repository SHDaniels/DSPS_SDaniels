This homework was about using gaussian processes to interpolate and...exterpolate...data. 
It was very helpful for me to understand more concretely how GPs work.
I worked mostly alone on this homework with the help of ChatGPT for combining kernels, 
and Willow for troubleshooting parameter guesses.

The hardest part was figuring out how to compare the real and GP points given that the dates
are slightly different. ChatGPT also helped me with that.
The easiest part was the plotting (yay plotting).
