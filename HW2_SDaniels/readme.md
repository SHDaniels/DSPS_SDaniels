In this homework, I worked with Tali and Paula for problem 1. We all discussed all the steps and coded next
to each other so that we could discuss what commands to use. I worked by myself for problem 2 but Sid helped with
the curve fit!

Each student must write a README file for their repository
in the readme you must state in your own words
1. what was this homework about? relate it to what we discussed in class
2. what was the hardest part of the homework for you?
3. what was the easiest part of the homework for you?
4. one new thing that you have learned

1. This homework was about statistics and what characteristics of a population we 
  can get from a sample. We became familiar with various distributions. We 
  tested the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers.

2. The hardest part of the homework was starting the second problem -
  I just got kind of overwhelmed looking at how long the example notbook was
  and trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing!

3. The easiest part of the homework was the plotting. Matplotlib is my friend :)

4. Honestly I did not realize the difference between the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem!
   This was a great example of it though so I figured it out :)
