should have a statement of what the hw is about, who you worked with, highlight what you took primary responsibility for and what you go the most help with (just be honest, it is for self-reflection, dont both say the same things though) (just say who did what)
A statement must be included in the README explaining each team memberâ€™s contribution

Each student must write a README file for their repository

in the readme you must state in your own words
1. what was this homework about? relate it to what we discussed in class
2. what was the hardest part of the homework for you?
3. what was the easiest part of the homework for you?
4. one new thing that you have learned
