This homework explored different methods of clustering and projecting many-dimensional data into two dimensions. 
I learned not to trust that the shape of the data in a 2d projections contains anything meaningful,
since changing the parameters can completely alter the shape. I also understand all of the clustering
algorithms much better after running them all.
I worked with Paula, who helped me understand the data, and loosely with Tali and Masooma. I did not
use code from anyone else. Willow helped me understand the k-means clustering aspect.

The hardest part was understanding what the data mean (also playing with the parameters for the 2d projections).
The easiest part was running various skl clustering methods since it was always the same structure of code.
