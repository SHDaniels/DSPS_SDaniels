This homework was about trying to make a model to fit data in various ways. The newest was by using a MCMC, 
and we also used skl minimize with various metrics as well as linear regression.

I sat near Zach and Masooma for part of my work on this so we exchanged ideas,
but we didn't exchange any code. Willow helped immensely with the signs for the likelihood etc. so that they could be minimized.

The hardest part of this was trying to understand all of the various functions that we used in this assignment,
and troubleshooting the likelihood section.
The easiest was writing captions for Fed's MCMC (but this was still an instructive part of the assignment).
One new thing that I learned was how to use emcee. I also learned about the ratio test, AIC, and CIB for the first time.
