I am taking this class because I think it will be useful for my data science-flavored research, and I want to have more of a background in it!

I hope to learn about basic statistics because somehow I have never done that yet lol, and everything else too that I don't even know about yet.

The strengths that will help me the most in this class are my enjoyment of problem-solving, perseverance on tough issues, and ability to 
reach out to classmates and Willow when I need advice.
